abstract="Organizations across the globe gather more and more data. Large datasets require new approaches to analysis and processing, which include methods based on machine learning. In particular, the symbolic regression can provide many useful insights. Unfortunately, due to high resource requirements, the use of this method for large datasets might be unfeasible. In this paper we analyze a bottleneck in an open-source implementation of this method, we call hubert. We identify that the evaluation of individuals is the most costly operation. As a solution to this problem, we propose a new evaluation service based on the Apache Spark framework, which attempts to speed up computations by distributing them on a cluster of machines. We compare the performance of the service by analyzing the execution time for a number of samples with use of both implementations. Then we discuss how the computation time improves with increased amount of resources. Finally we draw conclusions and outline plans for further research.",

abstract="Service-oriented architectures (SOA) is an emerging approach that addresses the requirements of loosely coupled, standards-based, and protocol- independent distributed computing. Typically business operations running in an SOA comprise a number of invocations of these different components, often in an event-driven or asynchronous fashion that reflects the underlying business process needs. To build an SOA a highly distributable communications and integration backbone is required. This functionality is provided by the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that is an integration platform that utilizes Web services standards to support a wide variety of communications patterns over multiple transport protocols and deliver value-added capabilities for SOA applications. This paper reviews technologies and approaches that unify the principles and concepts of SOA with those of event-based programing. The paper also focuses on the ESB and describes a range of functions that are designed to offer a manageable, standards-based SOA backbone that extends middleware functionality throughout by connecting heterogeneous components and systems and offers integration services. Finally, the paper proposes an approach to extend the conventional SOA to cater for essential ESB requirements that include capabilities such as service orchestration, ``intelligent'' routing, provisioning, integrity and security of message as well as service management. The layers in this extended SOA, in short xSOA, are used to classify research issues and current research activities.",

abstract="This work presents the EvoSpace model for the development of pool-based evolutionary algorithms (Pool-EA). Conceptually, the EvoSpace model is built around a central repository or population store, incorporating some of the principles of the tuple-space model and adding additional features to tackle some of the issues associated with Pool-EAs; such as, work redundancy, starvation of the population pool, unreliability of connected clients or workers, and a large parameter space. The model is intended as a platform to develop search algorithms that take an opportunistic approach to computing, allowing the exploitation of freely available services over the Internet or volunteer computing resources within a local network. A comprehensive analysis of the model at both the conceptual and implementation levels is provided, evaluating performance based on efficiency, optima found and speedup, while providing a comparison with a standard EA and an island-based model. The issues of lost connections and system parametrization are studied and validated experimentally with encouraging results, that suggest how EvoSpace can be used to develop and implement different Pool-EAs for search and optimization.",
